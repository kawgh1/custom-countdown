# custom-countdown
custom countdown app based on Zero to Mastery project.

I added custom alert message, music and other styling.

Added PHP files to enable a (PHP) buildpack for Heroku deployment.

Heroku does not support basic HTML, CSS, JS deployment.

This enables the background video to run, which GitHub Pages does not support.
